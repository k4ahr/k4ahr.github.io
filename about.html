            <h2>About myself</h2>
            <p>My primary language is Vietnamese, but I can also understand English.</p>
            <p>I play lots of different games. I have played "video games" since the first time I used a computer, most likely Flash games back then. I grew up playing many other games, but time by time I have reduced the number of different games that I play now.</p>
            <p>I listen to multiple genres of music, but mostly melancholia and pop. My favorite artists are Joji and The Weeknd. Some other genres that are honorable mentions are rock and R&B. I also listen to some Vietnamese indie and also Japanese Vocaloid.</p>
            <p>I first and having been using Linux since 2018, and also gained an understanding of open source software and the philosophy behind all of it, as well as deep down the iceberg of privacy and the Internet in general, which sometimes caused me to be paranoid. But I guess it's good to be skeptical sometimes.</p>
