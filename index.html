        <h2>Hi, I'm Hwng</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an 18-year-old Vietnamese who's wandering across the Internet. 
            I love amuse oneself with tech in common, and other things related such as cinematography, music and coding.

        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>
            I use Vietnamese as my main language while also having understanding of English.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I play lots of different games. I have played "video games" since the first time I used a computer, most likely Flash games back then. I grew up playing many other games, but time by time I have reduced the number of different games that I play now.   
        </p>
        <p>
            I listen to multiple genres of music, but mostly melancholia and pop. My favorite artists are Joji and The Weeknd. Some other genres that are honorable mentions are rock and R&N. I also listen to some Vietnamese indie and also Japanese Vocaloid.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first and having been using Linux since 2018, and also gained an understanding of open source software and the philosophy behind all of it, as well as deep down the iceberg of privacy and the Internet in general, which sometimes caused me to be paranoid. But I guess it's good to be skeptical sometimes.         </p>
