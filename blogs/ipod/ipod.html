                <h2>Using an iPod as the primary music listening option</h2>
                <h3 id="date">2024, Dec 9</h3>
                <p>There is a recent trend lately about using iPods â€” Apple's infamous music device back in the 2000s, as alternative for most of the music streaming services nowadays, like Spotify or Apple Music. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/188gf5u/what_exactly_is_the_point_of_using_an_ipod/">medias</a> are claiming that using a external device for music playing gives you many multiple advantages that related to distraction in working and ownership of the music that you listening to.</p>
                <p>So I bought one for myself to check out if all the hypes were real. In October I bought a second-hand iPod Classic 5 (aka iPod Video) from Neyako for $50, which was a good deal at the moment since the demand for iPods was really high. The iPod has been replaced with a brand new battery and modified with a brand new 120GB SSD.</a></p>

                <h3>The hype is real</h3>
                <p>After two months of using the iPod (as of the time this post is being written), I can confirm that the hype was true. Using an iPod does help me reduce distraction and procrastination when compared to listening to music on my smartphone, as I can focus more on most of my work. Using a phone can lead to other unnecessary activities, such as browsing social media or other distractions.</p>
                <p>Using an iPod also makes me appreciate each and every song that I have on my iPod. Of course, I'm using a modified firmware called <a href="https://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a>, so I can't say that I have the "legal" ownership to every song in my iPod, but at least I do have control over my music rather than having a subscription for music streaming services. Not to mention, the music quality has a huge boost when I switch from my phone with a TWS headphone to an iPod with an IEM headphone, which is a Moondrop Lan.</p>

                <h3>The cons</h3>
                <p>Talking back and forth, iPod also has its cons. No matter if you use purchased music from iTunes or ripped from other services, it's troublesome and inconvenient to always have a computer for adding or removing music. Another thing is that I use last.fm, so my listened tracks cannot be scrobbled, but to my surprise, Rockbox actually supports last.fm music scrobbling; it's just that the scrobbling has to be imported manually.</p>
                <h3>Should you buy an iPod in 2025 ?</h3>
                <p>If you are the kind of person that loves music, and you also love old tech, then you should definitely buy an iPod for a better music experience, with also a nostalgic feeling.</p>
