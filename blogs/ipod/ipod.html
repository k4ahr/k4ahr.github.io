                <h2>Using an iPod as the primary music listening option</h2>
                <h3 id="date">2024, Dec 9</h3>
                <p>There is a recent trend lately about using iPod - Apple infamous music device back in the 2000s, as alternative for most of music streaming services nowadays like Spotify or Apple Music. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/188gf5u/what_exactly_is_the_point_of_using_an_ipod/">medias</a> claiming that using a external device for music playing gives you many multiple advantages that related to distraction in working and ownership of the music that you listening to.</p>
                <p>So I bought one for myself to checkout if all the hypes were real. In October I bought a second-hand iPod Classic 5 (aka iPod Video) from <a href="https://neyako.works">Neyako</a> for $50, which was a good deals at the momment since the demand for iPod was really high. The iPod has been replaced with a brand new battery, and modified with a brand new 120GB SDD.</a></p>
                <img id="ipod1" src="ipod1.jpg" title="Image of the iPod when I recieved">
                <p>After two months of using iPod (as the time this post is being writed), I can confirm that the hype was true. Using iPod does help me reducing distraction and procastination when comparing to listen to music on my smartphone, as I can more focus on most of my works. When using a phone, it can cause me to also have other unnecessary activities on my phone, whether it's browsing social media or anything else.</p>
