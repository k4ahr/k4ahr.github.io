	    <p>Whoa a website, and a blog post? That's cool, how did you do it? Is it hard, or free...

	    Well I don't know, I guess this is my first ever blog post, but not my first website...
	    I first learned making a website when I was 11, the idea was using a tool from Google, called "Google Sites". A simple site builder back then, with easy text edit and integration, except that its had to based on specific templates made by Google.

	    So the second option was by make it from scratch: HTML and CSS. I actually followed a paid course just to make this. They provided me the software, documents and tutorial, and even a limited time free hosting. But the "Make it from scratch" only took around 20% of the course, which all containing how to code HTML, CSS and managing a database such as mySQL. The rest of the course taught me a easier way to make a website: WordPress! We will talk deeper about WordPress later.

	    As I more understanding the mechanism of "How the Internet worked", hosting a website is never free. I hadn't had any source of income back then until 16, and yet the idea of having a "portfolio website" still in my mind. One of my other idea was using linktr.ee, and I tried it. To be fair, it was free, but it did not fit as what I wanted, other than just showing a custom line, and then attach a bunch of social media links. So I just quit.

	    Few years later, I stumbled across videos about homelab: a homemade server, with your own hardware and your own service. So I tried it. I spent lots of cash and time, created a homelab, bought a domain, using it with Docker and many other service such as Adguard and Jellyfin. And for website, I used WordPress. 

	    The thing that I don't like about WordPress is, it need an external database. And everytime the homelab is fucked up, troubleshoot is just a pain in the ass. And it also uses a lot, and A LOT, resource of the homelab. Eventually, my homelab was downed because of hardware failure, specific the CPU was cooked because of the bad power supply. And so once again, my personal website was downed.

	    But then I learned from some tech nerds on Discord. Github, a place where you upload your code of something, for free. And they do support making a website too! So I spent around a month, remember all what I studied 10 years ago about HTML and CSS. And now here is it.

	    For now this website will be a place for my self-bio and also blog posts as I starting to merge from my Facebook account. Also this website takes a lot of references and style from another website of other person that I met online: VnPower (if you are reading this I want to say thanks, while also sorry for copying your website's style and make mine similar).

	    It's 2024, my first year in college, and I guess this is my first ever completed project that related to my major - computer science. Still a lots thing to do, but I guess this is just getting started.
